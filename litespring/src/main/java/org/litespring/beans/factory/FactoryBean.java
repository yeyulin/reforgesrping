/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory}
 * which are themselves factories. If a bean implements this interface,
 * it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a bean
 * instance that will be exposed itself.
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a
 * normal bean.</b> A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the
 * object exposed for bean references ({@link #getObject()} is always
 * the object that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can
 * either create objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup.
 * The {@link SmartFactoryBean} interface allows for exposing
 * more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for
 * example for the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean}
 * or the {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}.
 * It can be used for application components as well; however,
 * this is not common outside of infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> FactoryBean objects participate in the containing
 * BeanFactory's synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no
 * need for internal synchronization other than for purposes of lazy
 * initialization within the FactoryBean itself (or the like).
