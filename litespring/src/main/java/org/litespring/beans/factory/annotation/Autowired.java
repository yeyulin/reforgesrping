/**
 * Marks a constructor, field, setter method or config method as to be
 * autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities.
 *
 * <p>Only one constructor (at max) of any given bean class may carry this
 * annotation, indicating the constructor to autowire when used as a Spring
 * bean. Such a constructor does not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any
 * config methods are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>Config methods may have an arbitrary name and any number of arguments;
 * each of those arguments will be autowired with a matching bean in the
 * Spring container. Bean property setter methods are effectively just
 * a special case of such a general config method. Such config methods
 * do not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>In the case of multiple argument methods, the 'required' parameter is
 * applicable for all arguments.
 *
 * <p>In case of a {@link java.util.Collection} or {@link java.util.Map}
 * dependency type, the container will autowire all beans matching the
 * declared value type. In case of a Map, the keys must be declared as
 * type String and will be resolved to the corresponding bean names.
 *
 * <p>Note that actual injection is performed through a
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor
 * BeanPostProcessor} which in turn means that you <em>cannot</em>
 * use {@code @Autowired} to inject references into
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor
 * BeanPostProcessor} or
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor BeanFactoryPostProcessor}
 * types. Please consult the javadoc for the {@link AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor}
 * class (which, by default, checks for the presence of this annotation).
